## Abstract

Throughput has always been a key metric to rate the efficiency of an Operating System. Recent growth in computer hardware technologies has increased the throughput of modern computers by a large margin but is the current Operating system architecture utilizing the capability of the hardware efficiently? This paper focuses on the key factors on which the throughput of an OS depends and how it can be maximized by providing a better abstraction for other hardware components like for example a GPU.
